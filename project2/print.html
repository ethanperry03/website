                <li> Large Format Roland SolJet ProII V SE-545 EX
                    <ul>
                        <li>With a wide variety of materials and 54" in width, it seems there's nothing our Roland 
                            can't accomplish that would have been otherwise impossible or at the very least cost-prohibitive to do.</li>

                        <li>Using Roland's Eco-Sol MAX ink the SE-545 EX will create full color weather resistant (up to 5 years) 
                            banners, decals, and vehicle graphics to get you noticed.</li>

                        <li> With it's built-in cutting plotter your custom shaped decals will stand apart from the crowd.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> We mentioned that the Roland will custom cut your digitally printed decals. 
                            But it doesn't have to print to cut. </li>
                        <li> We cut colored vinyl as well. Suitable for window signage and vehicle lettering, 
                            colored vinyl is the durable bold solution. </li>
