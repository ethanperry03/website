            <h3>Screen Making</h3>
            <p class="indented">A few of our clients do their own printing, either for in-house quality control purposes or 
                because they enjoy getting ink under their nails. The reasons are varied. We service certain industries, 
                such as those in electronics manufacturing, stained-glass, and even other screen printers who are not set 
                up to make their own screens. So whatever your reason, we can custom-make your screens too.</p>

            <ul class="listing">
                <li> Mesh
                    <ul>
                        <li>All the mesh we use is polyester mono-filament mesh. (Silk has not been used in the industries for years. 
                            This is the reason why the term Silk-screening is frowned upon.) Mesh coarseness is determined by thread-count.</li>

                        <li> We carry many different thread counts (measured in threads-per-inch); each has a different 
                            usage or is more suitable for different ink viscosities.</li>

                        <li> Thinner inks, such as epoxy and UV, would require a higher thread count to 
                            reduce the amount of ink that passes through. </li>

                        <li> Thicker inks, like Plastisols, or inks with a large particulate, like metallic flake, 
                            require a lower thread count to let more ink through and leave a heavier lay-down.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li> Emulsion
                    <ul>
                        <li>Graphic Images uses Autotype's Autosol Classic emulsion for our stencils for resistance to solvents and water.</li>
                        <li>The stencil is made by contact exposure. This process involves using the photo-reactive emulsion, 
                            a film positive, a very large vacuum frame, and a bright light source</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
            <p>With a clear understanding of your project, we can customize your screen to meet your needs. 
                The last thing we want is to give you a screen that you can't use.</p>

            <ul class="listing">
                <li> Overall size
                    <p class="fullindent">
                        Sometimes you have to print inside an item such as a metal enclosure. If there's room, we can make that screen.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li> Metal Edges
                    <p class="fullindent">
                        Like above, sometimes there doesn't appear to be enough room to print where you would like, such as in a 
                        corner or next to some other immovable item. By replacing parts of your wooden frame with thinner metal edges, 
                        allowing you to print much closer to your obstacles.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li> "Extreme" Modifications
                    <p class="fullindent">
                        Sometimes replacing a single or even two sides won't get you past that obstacle, or you have to print around an object.
                         In this case we can cut a channel out of the frame or even poke a hole in the screen.</p>
                    <p class="fullindent">
                        "Poke a hole in the screen?" Sure, if that's what needs to be done. By reinforcing the mesh around the 
                        section with a dimensionally stable mylar, it's perfectly okay to cut small voids from the mesh.
                    </p>
                </li>
